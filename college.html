          <p>For my senior capstone project, I've been leading a two teams working with Nebraska Medicine to create a virtual reality training
            program to help emergency department staff members learn how to identify patients who have highly contagious diseases, isolate them,
            and inform proper authorites about the outbreak of the disease. My responsibilites have been helping the teams figure out how to 
            split up the tasks to complete them as effeciently as possible, keeping track of assignments needed to be turned in for the class,
            being the main point of contact for Nebraska Medicine, and I have learned a little bit of VR development along the way.

            Since the spring semester of 2022, I have been an undergraduate teaching assistant for multiple different computer science classes.
            These classes are Introduction to Discrete Structures, Software Engineering, and Software Security in Practice. As a teaching assistant 
            I hold office hours for a minimum of two hours a week for students to drop by in if they have questions or need help and grade assignments.

            During my sophomore and junior year I was in the club initalize. In this club, we would go to elementary schools in Lincoln and run an 
            after school club available for 4th and 5th graders to learn about robotics and coding basics. We used LEGO Spike kits for the kids to 
            put together. We created lesson plans for them to follow to learn how to code the robots to move around and created challenges for them 
            to figure out.
