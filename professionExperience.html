          Over the summer of 2023, I interned at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. While I was here, I worked on 
          a project for the human resources center from start to finish using a technology no one else at the Fed had experience 
          with. This project was a low-code no-code solution due to the time restriction of getting past the security restrictions.
          I worked closely with another intern on this project and together we followed Agile methodology, learned lots about 
          the design process and UI/UX design. We worked closely with our stakeholders and created a user guide for future maintence.

          Recently, I've been working on a lot of new development where I've been creating dashboards to help the warehouse workers
